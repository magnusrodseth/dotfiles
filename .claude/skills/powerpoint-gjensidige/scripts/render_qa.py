"""Render every slide to a PNG for visual QA. Works on macOS, Windows and Linux.

Converter priority, per platform:

  macOS    Microsoft PowerPoint via AppleScript, else LibreOffice
  Windows  Microsoft PowerPoint via PowerShell COM, else LibreOffice
  Linux    LibreOffice

PowerPoint is preferred where present because it is the renderer the audience
opens the file in, so font substitution and text fit are truthful. LibreOffice
substitutes the Gjensidige fonts, which makes its text-fit check approximate:
leave slack in tight boxes when that is all you have.

PDF to image goes through poppler (`pdftoppm`), else mutool, else PyMuPDF. That
order is deliberate: PyMuPDF is the only one of the three that needs no install,
but it silently drops and mis-places text in the PDFs PowerPoint for Mac
produces, because the Gjensidige fonts are embedded there as TrueType subsets.
A QA image that invents defects is worse than no QA image, so the fallback
warns when it is used. `brew install poppler` is the fix.

Rendering is meant to be safe to run while someone is working. The only deck
this closes is the one being rendered, and PowerPoint is left running unless it
was this script that started it.
