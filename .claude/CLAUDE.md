## Personal Hubs

Cross-cutting repos I refer to from anywhere (paths are `$HOME`-relative; identical layout on both machines):

- `~/dev/personal/vault`: Obsidian second brain. Notes, people, projects, meetings, health, travel, Personlig Økonomi. Read its `CLAUDE.md` before writing to it. Use the `read-up-on` skill for briefings, the `vault` skill for capturing knowledge.
- `~/dev/personal/presentations`: all my talks and slide decks (TanStack Start app, deployed to presentations.magnusrodseth.com). Read its `AGENTS.md` before working in it. Use the `scaffold-presentation` skill to create new decks.
- `~/dotfiles`: machine config, stow-managed. All user-scope agent skills live in `.claude/skills/` here (`~/.claude` is a symlink into this repo).

## Dev Server

If a project ships an agent-friendly dev command (a background launcher with
idempotent status/stop, e.g. `make dev` / `make dev-status` / `make dev-stop`
in hei-huset-agent), use it — those are safe for me to start, query, and stop.
Otherwise, when servers are run manually in separate terminals, assume they're
already running and don't launch them in the foreground (a foreground `dev`
blocks indefinitely).

## Task Completion Rules

**NEVER stop a task prematurely.** If you start something, finish it.

- Do not stop with "I've made progress, let me pause here" or "I'll update the todo and stop"
- Do not ask for permission to continue mid-task - just continue
- Do not summarize partial progress as if the task is done
- If fixing errors: run the check command, fix ALL errors, repeat until the command exits 0
- If a todo item exists and is not complete, you are NOT done
- If you hit a wall, try a different approach rather than stopping
- Only stop when the task is actually complete with verification

**Completion means:**
- Build/type-check commands exit 0
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- All todo items marked complete
- The original request is fully satisfied, not partially

## Writing Style

- **Never use em dashes** (—). Use alternatives: commas, parentheses, colons, semicolons, or separate sentences.

## Norwegian Text

- When working with Norwegian text, always ensure correct grammar and spelling, including proper use of **æ, ø, å** (and **Æ, Ø, Å**). Verify these characters are not accidentally replaced with ae, o, a or other ASCII equivalents.
